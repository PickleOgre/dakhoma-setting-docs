Magic suffuses and gives life to the world. 
# Magical Practices
[[The Knowing of Faces]] is a way of seeing deeply to the essence of things, practiced by the native Skyreachers. This art, passed down from teacher to apprentice, gives them an intimate and powerful connection to their homeland.

The [[Masks of Skyreach]], not merely a cultural practice, are magical in themselves. Masks protect the wearer from sorcery, and some masks are infused with arcane or divine power.

The [[Knightly Orders of Dakhoma]] gain power from their oaths.
