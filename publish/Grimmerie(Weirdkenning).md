Grimmerie is the practice of creating magical contraptions using systems of runes called sigils. Among Skyreachers, the practice is referred to as Weirdkenning, and is expressly forbidden by the Woodkenners. In the Dark Sun Federation, however, grimmerie is a respectable profession, and grimmers are the engineers and inventors behind many of the world's most useful advancements. Much of the uneducated populace of the Federation, however, are wary or suspicious of grimmerie, and treat grimmers with a certain superstitious fear. The basic rules of Grimmerie are simple: any physical machine, i.e. a device that transfers or transforms energy by doing work, can be created using systems of runes and sigils.
# Sigils
Basically, runes represent types of energy, such as kinetic, thermal, or electric. Sigils are created by combining multiple runes, and defining how the energy is collected, stored, and released. Every sigil is simply a glyphic machine, capable of taking energy as input, storing and channeling it as magical energy, and transforming it in some way. No machine is perfect however, and some energy is always wasted. All contraptions have some amount of magical "impedance" which represents how easily it conducts magical energy. Higher impedance means more energy is lost when the sigil is active. Lost energy manifests as sonic vibrations, usually barely audible, which the Skyreachers call "Noise."
