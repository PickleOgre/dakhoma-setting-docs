The Gaisedai, or warriors, are nobles who serve royalty. The Woodkenners are the educated class, performing the roles of bards, priests, scientists, and other professions. Above them are the royalty, with lesser kings and queens paying tribute to over-kings and high kings. Over all, the High Grove of Druids are considered the wisest of people and hold equal or greater authority to the high kings.
