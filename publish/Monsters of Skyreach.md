## Weird Avatars
When a person or beast is possessed by a Weird mask, they retain little of their humanity, transforming into mutated horrors and driven mad with the power of the Noise.

## Chimeras

Chimera is the blanket term applied to creatures who appear to be made up of two or more animals. What they are, and how they came to be, remain a constant mystery, even to the woodkenners. Encounters with these creatures are few and far between, but often dangerous, if not deadly.
