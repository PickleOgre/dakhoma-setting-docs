## Weird Avatars
When a person or beast is possessed by a Weird mask, they retain little of their humanity, transforming into mutated horrors and driven mad with the power of the Noise.

## Chimeras

Chimera is the blanket term applied to creatures who appear to be made up of two or more animals. What they are, and how they came to be, remain a constant mystery, even to the woodkenners. Encounters with these creatures are few and far between, but often dangerous, if not deadly.


## Seemings
Seeming is the name given to all those apparitions that appear in the forest to decieve folk. Wild deer that vanish into thin air, phantom fires in the distance, pools of water that only seem real from far away, are believed to be illusions caused by magic. The nature and origin of these illusions are wildly speculated, and even the woodkenners have no concensus about them.
