Knights strive to be bastions of virtue, bestowing guidance, judgment, and retribution upon an imperfect world. They are distinguished by their oaths, which give them magical power and authority in the eyes of the people.

## Knights of Skyreach
The Gaisedai are the warrior class of Skyreach. Gaisedai are organized into schoficts, or fighting schools, which train soldiers on behalf of noble families and chiefs. All Gaisedai warriors are bound to a strict code of chivalric honor, and are said to have no fear of death in battle. But the greatest of all warriors are the Knights of Skyreach, who serve only their oaths and their orders.
