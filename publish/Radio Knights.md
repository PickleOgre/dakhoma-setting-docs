The **Radio Knights** are an order of monster hunters who use the power of the Pluto Knives to uproot corruption and destroy monstrous beings in Skyreach.Â  Their oath prohibits worshiping any god, and they alone are immune to the radiant power of the Pluto Knives.

## The Pluto Knives
Forged from the fuel rods of an ancient nuclear reactor, the Pluto knives are the Knights' last resort against evil. The oath of a radio knight protects them from all radiant damage, making them and them alone immune to the knives' deadly aura.
