An Agent is a tool, something or someone that the World uses to depict an environment that _Makes Sense_, to _Rock the Boat_ by shaking things up, and bring a specific **theme** to the fore.

An Agent is **not** necessarily adverse or dangerous to the Protagonists. An Agent **acts** of its own accord and volition, out of the Protagonists’ control. That’s all it is and all it does. Sometimes it will provide help and opportunities. Sometimes it will provide opposition and adversity. Sometimes it will just shift things around in a way that isn’t obviously good or bad.
