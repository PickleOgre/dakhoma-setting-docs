The Night Folk are an elusive and cryptic people who make their homes in warrens deep in the mountains. They are wise in magic and in mushroom lore, and they are friends of bats and frogs.
## Origin
The woodkenners tell that long ago, when the dragons returned to Dakhoma, those ferocious reptiles became humanity's most fearsome predator. Humans adapted over time in several ways. The ancestors of the Common Folk built homes in tall trees to avoid the beasts, and they built better tools and made great strides in technology that allowed them to survive. The Night Folk played another evolutionary trick: they became nocturnal, gaining powerful darkvision and camouflaged skin, allowing them to avoid the dragons altogether.
