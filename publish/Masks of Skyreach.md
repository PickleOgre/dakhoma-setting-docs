>There are two things that any outsider should know about the Skyreach mountains. The first is that all Skyreachers wear masks, not to hide from the world, but so that they can face the world without fear. Any witch or spirit who has seen a person’s face may work a curse against that person, so they say, and it is unspeakably rare to see a Skyreacher unmasked, even while they sleep. The second is that all Skyreachers revere their elders greatly. So when Grandfather took back the mask he had given to the girl Shenga when she came of age, the pine mask in the form of a rabbit’s face that fit her so well, saying that she had consorted with the evil powers of the earth and she had no place in the village anymore, the people turned their faces away from her without a word. As she shivered and cried in the firelit night, the last to look away were her parents, who knew her true face. Her brother Ban, though, a little boy of five winters, had never seen her unmasked, and he stared at her naked face with the shameless gaze of a child as she ran weeping into the woods.

## All Skyreachers Wear Masks
#### The Wilding
Mask-wearing is one of the most peculiar features of Skyreach culture, and a defining feature of the mountain natives. When a boy or girl reaches the age of about 9 years, a ritual of passage is performed. The ritual varies by tribe, but generally the child is administered a magic potion called wilding water, which allows them to speak to and understand the spirits of any living thing. A woodkenner, preferably an Ovate, facilitates the ritual from beginning to end, sometimes for multiple children at the same time. 

When the neophyte has taken a dose of the wilding water, they begin a journey in which they wander in the forest, usually for at least a day. During this time, they can hear the voices of the animals and plants around them, and although the ritual is risky, most folk find the experience incredibly transformative. The first living creature to speak to the child is their mask-creature and later a mask will be made in its image for them to wear. 

#### Masking Ceremony
When the initiate returns to the village, they recount their narrative to the officiating woodkenner. The woodkenner then either carves a mask or commissions one from a maskmaker. A festival is held in honor of the initiate, and traditional dances are held. Finally, the woodkenner presents the mask and the initiate wears it for the first time, taking their position as a Skyreacher and an adult of the tribe.

## Mask-Making
Mask-makers hold a unique position in Skyreach society. On the one hand, they are simple woodcarvers, plying their trade in the day-to-day production of tool handles and furniture. On the other, they are often the only person in the village who has seen the face of every single person there. This gives them a spiritual and often fearful role, and they are distrusted by most - a common saying holds that "the only trustworthy mask-maker is a blind mask-maker." Although in reality, most mask-makers would not betray a trust, but some are known to deal in curses, performing vile weird-craft for coin. Nevertheless, their business is absolutely essential.
## Masks of Power
All masks carry spiritual significance, but there are some which hold magical power as well. God masks hold the spirit of a deity, soul masks gain power from the spirits of dead heroes or beloved ancestors, and weird masks embody evil spirits, demons, or the impure dead.

When a human wears a mask of power, the spirit contained in the artifact gains partial control of their body. Depending on the character of the mask, that spirit may come into conflict with the wearer's soul, causing no small amount of stress to the wearer. When a mask and its wearer disagree, the wearer must dominate the mask in a battle of wills, lest they become an Avatar of the mask, forever a victim to its will. Some shamans and mad prophets become Avatars willingly, surrendering themselves wholly to the supernatural. 
#### God Masks
All the spirits and gods of Skyreach are said to wear masks. At tribal meetings and woodkenner sabbats, theatrical rituals are performed in which certain participants wear god masks in order to play the role of that god and reenact their stories. 
#### Soul Masks
When a person dies, their mask is often burned along with their body, but some folk preserve the soul of the dead one in their mask. In many tribes they are passed down as heirlooms and placed in ancestral shrines, with older families having dozens or more. Families have the opportunity to commune with their dead family through trained mediums, who wear the masks and speak with the voices of the fallen.
#### Weird Masks
No human being should ever make, wear, or even look at a weird mask. These abominations can be identified by the sense of gnawing dread that takes hold of anyone who beholds them, accompanied by the subtle noise of tinnitus. Inhabited by dark gods, fallen angels, and spirits of The Noise, these masks tempt mortals with great power, but at a terrible risk. Those who are possessed by weird masks never return to their former selves, their minds shattered by overwhelming malice and madness.
