The **Knights Vulgate** are an order of police-judges whose oath prohibits showing indifference to the suffering of any human being. The power of their oath grants them the trust and understanding of anyone who hears them speak.

## Structure of the Knights
Anyone can become a Knight Vulgate. The words of the oath are widely known and repeated in common children's rhymes across Skyreach. But not everyone can keep the oath: A Knight Vulgate is forbidden to ignore *any* suffering of any kind. If a village girl is crying, the Knight must do their best to cheer her. In the event of a dragon attack, the Knight must show no cowardice. No task is too small - or too big.
