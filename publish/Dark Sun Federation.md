Far to the East, where the sun comes from, lies the Free City of Golmira. This teeming metropolis is the center of the Dark Sun Federation, a powerful alliance of three great city-states. 

## Treasure of the Sunken Library
Long ago, Annaeus the Prophet, by the guidance of the Great God Dzios, discovered a library buried beneath the waters of the Sea of Calamity. Within its hallowed archive he discovered a stone engraving of the Declaration of Independence, and a slightly water-damaged copy of the Constitution of the United States. From these documents, he was able to discern that the U.S. was a long-standing haven of democratic freedom, equal rights, and human welfare. So unassailable were the ideals of this prehistoric nation that Annaeus was deeply moved, and the great God Dzios came to him in a vision. Dzios remembered this ancient race and the time had come for a new, enlightened empire to rise. The god of the skies charged Annaeus with spreading the good news of union and liberty to the peoples of the three cities.

Annaeus was persecuted for his teachings, even jailed for a time, but his disciples gained power after the death of their teacher, eventually uniting the three cities and establishing within them three branches of government.

## The Three Great Cities
In each of the three cities was vested a portion of the powers of Government. Golmira, due to its industry and military prowess, became the Executive City. Bonna became the City of Judges. Porta Papyra, the City of Paper, became the seat of legislature.

## Internal Struggles
In the 343rd year of the Dark Sun, the Presidio of Golmira allowed some duties of the Executive City to be handled by private police forces.  This is believed to be one of the inciting incidents that caused the current ongoing power struggle between the three cities. With Golmira seeking ever greater legal powers and Bonna and Papyra fighting to preserve their role while fearing the retribution of Golmira's forces, the Dark Sun Federation creeps ever closer to authoritarian rule.

## Empire
The Dark Sun Federation encompasses the entire known world. Thirty years ago, the Federation added Skyreach to its massive bulk, establishing a permanent presence throughout the mountain range. The practice of Draking, or industrial dragon hunting, has left the territory around the Three cities nearly devoid of dragons, and hunts will likely expand further into the mountains.
