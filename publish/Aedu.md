Aedu is a wiry old ascetic who makes his living as a weather-worker on the misty slopes of the Silverheight. Wearing a mask of in the image of a flydragon, he **knows the face of the Wind and Storms**, and sees deeply into the suffering of others. Above all things, he treasures peace and contentment, and the freedom to live a simple life. To this end, he is remarkably self-sufficient, growing his own food by his hut at the peak of Grandmother Grey, and plying his mysterious trade endlessly to keep evil weather away from K'reff. Daily he ventures down the mountain on his swayback, Hess, to fetch water, and townsfolk may encounter him meditating by the river.

# Aedu's Hut
Aedu's humble home sits on Lookout Cliff, allowing the mystic meteorologist to survey the skies in all directions. His hut is draped with long strings of painted beads made from wood, nut, and horn, which he crafts in his rituals to record, predict, and influence the weather. By consulting his beads, Aedu can **recount what the weather was like** on any day since he first came to K'reff.
