Ancestral tomb/shrine for a dead lineage of knights, forgotten and overgrown in the forest ruins of their castle.

A labyrinth hidden beneath the earth, built ages ago in worship of unknown gods. A Night Folk priestess with no true face rules the unlit realm, and human captives are brought before the Faceless Ones for sacrifice.
