K'reff is a mining town on the misty forested slopes of the Silverheight in the heartlands of Skyreach. The K'reffites are deeply attached to the mountain, which they affectionately call "Grandmother Grey". Formerly the settlement was primarily sustained by farming and fishing, but with the advent of industrial mining, the town's economy now revolves around magic crystals. Newcomers to the town call it New Crystallo - the City of Crystals.

## The Fellowship of Shields
Our heroes are paragons of K'reff, common folk who take responsibility for defending the town from danger. As K'reff gradually shifts toward industrial capitalism, the party takes on the role of vigilantes, defending the common folk and pariah.
